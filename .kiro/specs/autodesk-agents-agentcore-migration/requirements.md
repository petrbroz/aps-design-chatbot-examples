# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating three existing Autodesk Data agents (ACC Model Properties Assistant, AEC Data Model Assistant, and APS Model Derivatives Assistant) from their current standalone FastAPI implementations to a unified AgentCore and Strands-based architecture. The migration will consolidate the agents into a single deployable model that maintains all existing functionality while providing improved scalability, maintainability, and deployment capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate the existing three Autodesk Data agents to use AgentCore and Strands architecture, so that I can have a unified, scalable, and maintainable deployment model.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality from the three original agents
2. WHEN the new architecture is implemented THEN the system SHALL use AgentCore as the foundational framework
3. WHEN the new architecture is implemented THEN the system SHALL use Strands for agent orchestration and management
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL support all three agent types (Model Properties, AEC Data Model, SQLite) within a single deployment

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with the migrated agents through the same interface patterns, so that my existing workflows are not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a prompt to any agent THEN the system SHALL return responses in the same format as the original implementations
2. WHEN a user authenticates THEN the system SHALL use the same OAuth flow and token validation as the original implementations
3. WHEN a user selects a design file THEN the system SHALL support the same project/version/URN identification patterns
4. WHEN caching is needed THEN the system SHALL maintain the same caching behavior for indexes, properties, and database files

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the migrated solution to be deployable as a single model, so that I can simplify deployment and maintenance operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the system THEN it SHALL be packaged as a single deployable unit
2. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL initialize all three agent types automatically
3. WHEN configuration is needed THEN the system SHALL use a unified configuration approach
4. WHEN scaling is required THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling through the AgentCore framework

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the agent tools and capabilities to be modularized and reusable, so that I can easily extend or modify individual agent functionalities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing tools THEN each agent's tools SHALL be organized in separate, reusable modules
2. WHEN adding new functionality THEN the system SHALL support plugin-style tool registration
3. WHEN tools are shared between agents THEN the system SHALL provide a common tool registry
4. WHEN tools need external dependencies THEN the system SHALL manage dependencies through a unified approach

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor system performance effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages with context
2. WHEN operations are performed THEN the system SHALL log all significant events with timestamps
3. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide structured logging that can be easily parsed
4. WHEN monitoring is required THEN the system SHALL expose metrics and health check endpoints

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the vector store implementation to be upgraded from FAISS to OpenSearch with Bedrock, so that I can have better scalability and cloud-native vector search capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AEC Data Model agent needs vector search THEN the system SHALL use OpenSearch with Bedrock instead of FAISS
2. WHEN property definitions are indexed THEN the system SHALL store them in OpenSearch vector store
3. WHEN similarity searches are performed THEN the system SHALL use OpenSearch's vector search capabilities
4. WHEN embeddings are generated THEN the system SHALL continue to use Bedrock embeddings service
5. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL automatically set up OpenSearch indexes if they don't exist

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to maintain backward compatibility with existing client applications, so that current integrations continue to work without modification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing clients make API calls THEN the system SHALL respond with the same API contract
2. WHEN authentication is performed THEN the system SHALL accept the same token formats and validation
3. WHEN responses are returned THEN the system SHALL maintain the same JSON structure and field names
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL return the same HTTP status codes and error formats
