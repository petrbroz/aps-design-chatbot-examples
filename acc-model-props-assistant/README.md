# ACC Model Properties Assistant

Experimental chatbot for querying design data in [Autodesk Construction Cloud](https://construction.autodesk.com/) using custom [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com) agents and [Autodesk Platform Services](https://aps.autodesk.com) ([ACC Model Properties API](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/acc/v1/tutorials/model-properties/)).

## How does it work?

The application implements a [LangGraph agent](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/migrate_agent/) with a couple of custom tools that let it talk to the [ACC Model Properties API](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/acc/v1/tutorials/model-properties/), and process JSON responses using [jq](https://jqlang.org/). The agent is also provided with a short guide explaining the syntax of the Model Properties Query Language (see [MPQL.md](./MPQL.md)).

After logging in an selecting a design, the user can start sending prompts to the agent. The agent will execute different types of tasks based on the user's prompt, for example:

- Create a new index using the Model Properties API
- Retrieve list of available index fields
- Generate and execute custom queries over the index
- Process JSON results using custom jq queries

## Usage

Login with your Autodesk credentials, select one of your design files in ACC, and try some of the prompts below:

> how many walls are there?

> what is the smallest and the largest volume of a wall?

> list the IDs of walls with volume larger than 1000.0 cubic meters

## Development

### Prerequisites
